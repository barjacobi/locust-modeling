\section{Introduction}

Locusts are well-known for their collective motion, where individuals alternate between solitary and gregarious phases. Modeling this behavior has been an active area of research, ranging from simple self-propelled particle (SPP) models to biologically detailed pause-and-go dynamics \cite{ariel2015locust}.  

Recent studies have shown that locust collective motion relies critically on \emph{pause-and-go dynamics}, in which individuals alternate between walking bouts and pauses. This intermittent locomotion is more than a mechanical artifact: it plays a central role in swarm cohesion and decision-making. Ariel et al. (2014) demonstrated that the timing of pauses carries signatures of memory and sensory integration, and that repeated pause/go decisions at the individual level drive the formation and maintenance of collective order in marching bands \cite{ariel2014pausego}. More recently, Aidan et al. (2024) showed that pauses are privileged moments for visual processing, with locusts most likely to align with neighbors when stimuli are presented during pauses  \cite{aidan2024pausing}. Together, these findings establish pause-and-go as a fundamental behavioral mechanism supporting swarm organization.  

In parallel, mathematical models have begun to capture these dynamics explicitly. Bernoff et al. (2020) developed an agent-based model and a companion PDE framework for the Australian plague locust, in which individuals switch between stationary (feeding) and moving states depending on local resource density. Their results demonstrate that resource-mediated transitions are sufficient to generate realistic hopper band fronts and traveling pulse structures \cite{bernoff2020agentbased}. While this work highlights the importance of foraging and vegetation depletion in shaping swarm morphology, our focus is narrower. We introduce a minimal continuous framework that abstracts the pause/go mechanism into a single activity variable, allowing us to explore how locomotor readiness and neighbor influence alone can generate collective motion, without explicitly modeling resource--behavior coupling.  

In this project, we therefore implement a minimal ODE-based model of locust collective motion. Each agent is represented by its position, heading, and an internal \emph{continuous activity variable}. This variable replaces the discrete pause/go states used in previous models. Biologically, it can be interpreted as a measure of locomotor readiness: $a=0$ corresponds to being fully paused, $a=1$ to full walking, and intermediate values to gradual activation or partial movement. Such a representation is consistent with observations that locusts accelerate gradually and that their responsiveness to neighbors increases smoothly with group density.  

Our goals are to (i) situate the model in relation to existing work, (ii) clarify its assumptions and simplifications, (iii) define all parameters and variables with units, and (iv) evaluate robustness via parameter sweeps and heatmaps.  

\section{Relation to Existing Models}

Ariel and Ayali (2015) review several frameworks for modeling locust collective motion:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{Czirók model} \cite{czirok1999collective}, a 1D variant of the Vicsek self-propelled particle model \cite{vicsek1995novel}, where individuals update their direction by aligning with the local average orientation of neighbors within an interaction radius, subject to noise. It captures order--disorder transitions and has been influential in statistical physics approaches to collective motion.

    \item The \textbf{Buhl model} \cite{buhl2006disorder}, a refinement motivated by ring-arena experiments, which adds persistence in direction. In this model, individuals weight their own previous heading against the local average, reproducing switching between clockwise and counter-clockwise marching observed in arenas.

    \item The \textbf{Pause-and-go model} \cite{ariel2014pausego}, derived from experimental observations that locusts exhibit intermittent motion composed of walking bouts and pauses. Individuals switch between discrete ``moving'' and ``paused'' states, with the probability of initiating movement depending on the number of walking neighbors. This framework highlights the role of intermittent locomotion in swarm cohesion.

    \item \textbf{Escape-and-pursuit (E\&P) models} \cite{romanczuk2012active}, motivated by the hypothesis that cannibalism drives collective motion. Here, individuals pursue conspecifics in front while escaping those approaching from behind. Although conceptually appealing, this mechanism has mixed empirical support in locusts.
\end{itemize}

Our approach is closest to the Vicsek/Czirók family of models but introduces an important modification. Instead of discrete pause/go states, we use a continuous-valued activity variable $a \in [0,1]$. This captures the same social dependence as the pause-and-go model but softens it into a smooth dynamical variable. The advantage is twofold: (i) it allows a natural biological interpretation as varying degrees of locomotor activation, and (ii) it yields a mathematically tractable ODE formulation suitable for robustness analysis.

\section{Model Definition}

Each locust is described by:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Position:} $(x,y)$, coordinates in a periodic square domain of side length $L$ (m). Periodic boundary conditions mean that when an individual crosses one boundary, it re-enters from the opposite side, effectively creating a toroidal space. This avoids artificial edge effects.
    \item \textbf{Direction:} $\theta$, orientation of movement (radians).
    \item \textbf{Activity:} $a \in [0,1]$, continuous locomotion variable (0 = paused, 1 = fully moving).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Activity dynamics}
Activity relaxes toward a sigmoid function of neighbor count $n_i$:
\begin{equation}
\frac{da_i}{dt} = -\frac{1}{\tau_a}\Big(a_i - \sigma(\beta_0 + \beta_1 n_i)\Big),
\label{eq:activity}
\end{equation}
where $\tau_a$ (s) is the relaxation timescale, $\beta_0$ is the baseline bias, and $\beta_1$ is the social activation gain.  

Neighbors $n_i$ are defined as the number of individuals within a vision radius $R$ of agent $i$. In our implementation, each neighbor contributes equally, but one possible extension is to weight neighbors by inverse distance, reflecting stronger influence from nearby individuals.

The sigmoid represents biologically plausible graded transitions: in many animal systems, movement does not engage instantly but ramps up. Speed, gait, and responsiveness transition continuously \cite{fukuchi2019gait}. Our model's continuous activity variable is inspired by such gradual biomechanical activation, and offers a realistic, smooth analogue to the binary pause--go concept.

\subsection{Velocity}
Speed varies between minimum and maximum values depending on activity:
\begin{equation}
v_i = v_{\min} + (v_{\max} - v_{\min}) a_i.
\label{eq:velocity}
\end{equation}
We chose $v_{\min} > 0$ to reflect that even ``paused'' locusts may exhibit micro-movements or shuffling rather than being perfectly stationary. This ensures smoother dynamics. Setting $v_{\min}=0$ is possible but makes simulations numerically less stable.

\subsection{Direction dynamics}
Directions evolve by alignment with neighbors plus noise:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\theta_i}{dt} = \kappa \cdot \langle \sin(\theta_j - \theta_i)\rangle + \sqrt{2\eta}\,\xi,
\label{eq:direction}
\end{equation}
where $\kappa$ is alignment strength, $\eta$ is noise intensity (rad$^2$/s), and $\xi$ is Gaussian white noise.  
The sine of the angle difference is standard in Vicsek/Czirók models: it ensures that alignment forces increase with angular difference and vanish when orientations coincide.

\subsection{Domain}
Motion occurs in a square domain with periodic boundary conditions, as defined above.

\section{Robustness Analysis}

To test robustness, we ran parameter scans. For each case we measured the \textbf{polarization}:
\[
P = \sqrt{\Big(\frac{1}{N}\sum_i \cos \theta_i\Big)^2 + \Big(\frac{1}{N}\sum_i \sin \theta_i\Big)^2}.
\]

$P=0$ means complete disorder; $P=1$ means perfect alignment.

\subsection{Scan 1: $\kappa$ vs $R$}
Polarization rises sharply when both alignment strength and vision radius are above threshold values, similar to the phase transition seen in Vicsek models.

    \caption{Polarization results for Scan 1 ($\kappa$ vs $R$). Stronger alignment and vision radius increase group order.}
    \label{fig:scan1}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Scan 2: $\kappa$ vs $\beta_1$}
Figure~\ref{fig:scan2} shows polarization across values of alignment strength $\kappa$ and social activation gain $\beta_1$. 
The dominant effect comes from $\kappa$: when $\kappa \lesssim 1.5$, polarization remains low regardless of $\beta_1$. 
At higher $\kappa$, increasing $\beta_1$ makes collective order more robust, lowering the threshold for the transition and sustaining polarization across a wider range of conditions. 
Thus, while $\beta_1$ does contribute to swarming, its effect is secondary compared to the role of alignment strength.

    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{k_vs_b1.png}
    \caption{Polarization increases sharply with $\kappa$, and higher $\beta_1$ slightly reduces the threshold for collective order.}
    \label{fig:scan2}
\end{figure}

\section{Discussion}

Our model differs from prior work in that it uses a continuous activity variable rather than a binary pause/go state. 
Biologically, this can be interpreted as a measure of \emph{locomotor readiness} or gradual acceleration: locusts do not always switch instantly between full pausing and full walking, but may exhibit intermediate levels of movement or responsiveness to neighbors. 
From a modeling perspective, this continuous formulation smooths out discontinuities, simplifies numerical analysis, and retains the threshold/saturation effects central to pause--and--go dynamics.  

Robustness analysis confirms that swarming arises only when alignment strength and social activation are sufficiently large, consistent with prior studies. 
However, we observed that the effect of $\beta_1$ (social activation gain) was weaker than anticipated: while higher $\beta_1$ does slightly lower the threshold for collective order, the dominant factor is alignment strength $\kappa$. 
This discrepancy may reflect the way neighbors were defined (equal weighting within radius $R$). 
Future refinements, such as distance-weighted neighbor contributions, could yield a stronger dependence on $\beta_1$ and bring the model closer to biological observations.  

While our model does not capture all biological details (e.g., discrete pausing, escape-and-pursuit asymmetries), it highlights the minimal ingredients necessary for collective order. 
According to Ariel and Ayali (2015), such simplified models are valuable for understanding general principles of swarm dynamics, even if they abstract away some biological realism.


\section{Conclusion}

We implemented and analyzed a continuous-activity ODE model of locust swarming. Our work shows that simple local rules (alignment, social activation, and noise) are sufficient to generate robust collective motion. By situating this model within the broader literature, we demonstrate both how it simplifies existing frameworks and what insights it contributes. The approach also emphasizes the importance of robustness checks and parameter documentation, ensuring reproducibility and interpretability.
